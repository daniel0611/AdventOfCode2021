This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021 challenges.

This year I'm going to use [Rust](https://rust-lang.com) because I've only used it in a couple very small projects and want to deepen my knowledge about it and gain more experience using it.

The solutions to the days can be run using `cargo run -p dayxy` (e.g. `-p day01`) and a new day can be generated by running `cargo run -p add-day`.
